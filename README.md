# Non-GUI-Programs-By-Python
<p>
  here i was trying to make some small-needy softwares using <b><i>python</b></i> which are <b>terminal</b> based.
<br>They are converted into exe files for windows users.
  <br>
  And for linux or others operating system user can run them in terminal using command $<b>python programme_name.py</b>
  
  <br>
  <ol>
  <li><b>Deletefiles </b>: this will ask two directories and delete the files having same name in the second directory.
  <li><b>SendEmail </b>: this is a software to mail easily but for gmail users you have to allow third party application from your email acoount setting.
  </ol>
